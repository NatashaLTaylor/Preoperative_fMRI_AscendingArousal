# Preoperative_fMRI_AscendingArousal
The following repository includes all relevant code for the analysis corresponding to the following paper "Preoperative Cholinergic Signatures Drive Segregated Brain Architecture in Postoperative Delirium" written by Dr. Natasha L Taylor et al.

# fMRI Analysis

All relevant for fMRI Analysis - note some of this code is overlaping with the following 

# Graph Theory Analysis
All graph theory analysis was conduced with Matlab V.2024b, note that relevant package is required for running graph theory calculations https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/
